 # 🎬 Netflix Data Exploration Project
## 📚 Project Background
Netflix, as one of the leading global streaming platforms, has amassed thousands of titles across multiple genres, countries, and formats (TV Shows and Movies). However, their raw dataset contains inconsistencies, missing values, and varied formats.
The goal of this project was to clean, explore, and analyze the Netflix catalog to uncover hidden patterns like genre popularity, release year trends, and the evolution of content types — while practicing real-world data cleaning and storytelling.

In this project, I cleaned, processed, and explored Netflix's title catalog to understand trends across genres, release years, and content types. The exploration provided valuable insights into Netflix’s growing content library over time, with specific patterns like a surge in TV Shows post-2015 and Drama dominating across all years. This project helped me challenge my skills in real-world messy data cleaning, missing value treatment, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving actionable storytelling from unstructured entertainment datasets.



## 📑 Project Deliverables and Actionable Insights
#### - Cleaned and standardized over 8,000 Netflix title records by fixing missing ratings, normalizing release dates, and handling absent director names.
#### - Visualized content trends showing that Drama is the most dominant genre across years.
#### - Discovered that after 2015, TV Shows production increased significantly compared to Movies.
#### - Identified the most common countries of production (e.g., USA, India, UK) and the spike of global content diversity post-2018.
#### - Revealed that most Netflix content is rated TV-MA and TV-14, reflecting a focus on mature audiences.

Initial checks performed:
Missing values found mostly in director, cast, country, rating, and date_added.
Inconsistent date and text formatting corrected.
Duplicates and irrelevant entries removed for cleaner analysis.

## 📈 Executive Summary
This Netflix Data Exploration project successfully transformed raw, inconsistent content data into clear, actionable insights. Through cleaning and exploratory analysis, key entertainment trends were identified — such as the dominance of drama genres, the rise of TV Shows in the past decade, and global expansion of Netflix’s catalog post-2018.
The project highlights practical real-world EDA skills, focusing on messy datasets common in media industries.

## ✔️ Recommendations
#### * Content Acquisition Focus: Increase investments in the Drama genre, given its overwhelming demand across years.
#### * Localized Content Strategy: Accelerate partnerships with content creators from countries like India and South Korea, based on the visible spike in titles from these regions.
#### * Audience Segmentation: Focus marketing strategies on mature content watchers (TV-MA, TV-14 ratings).
